# Advent of Code 2022
This is a repo with my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles. They will be mostly Rust but some Python might show up too. Each solutions expects a file called `input` in it's directory that contains the puzzle input. There probably won't be a lot of comments because stuff tends to be short and rather straight forward.
